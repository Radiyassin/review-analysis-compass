Unlocked, in a new factory box. The only tell that it was ""in hands"" is that the supplied USB cord was actually for 4 version, and would not charge 3GS. No big deal - there are plenty of old cables around. 4 stars for that, but $237 deal is sweet. The same phone in Target would cost $150 more.It will work with almost any carrier except probably Verizon (I use cheap $30 T-mobile 5 GB plan, no contract and no activation fee).

Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB Black Factory Unlocked / Not Jailbroken,Apple,33,3,"compared to my htc sensation (yes I know that phone is wayy advanced and the comparison would be unfair) which I destroyed by getting it wet, of course it*s hard for me to give the Iphone 3s a fair review.However, here my review:The Iphone 3 is pretty and has most things you would need in a smart phone.I like the texting, even though sometimes texts especially pictures won*t send and I have to send it over and over- despite having service in the area!service..... yes, sometimes there is no service in an area for no reason. kind of annoying. I always had service with my htc so it is not my service provider. My friend who has the Iphone3 says the same thing.. very annoying.I was spoiled by having a gps tell me when to turn - the iphone 3 comes with a navigation system which is a lifesaver so and so often - but you still have to flip thru the steps manually as you go which can get you a ticket or killed at times.Some of the apps I could get for free for Android I have to pay for now.. bummer.The camera is terrible sadly, no flash, and no front screen camera..However, the phone works, it*s pretty, and if you use your phone mainly for calling and texting and only need the internet at times it works very well. I love the way the voicemails are set up!!!I don*t understand btw why apple makes the front screen from glass!

So that was good. There are sites you can check to see if the iPhone is factory unlocked by inputting the MEID. I slipped in the SIM card and it works. The only thing is that the iPhone is a little beat up. You can tell that the screen was replaced cause they did not clean the under screen before applying the new screen and you can see dirt in it when looking at the screen in the light, which can be annoying.The iPhone works and battery is good.

Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB Black Factory Unlocked / Not Jailbroken,Apple,33,2,"Although the description says ""Can be upgraded, factory unlocked for any GSM carrier"" AND again states ""ready to be used on any GSM carrier worldwide"". They need to put a disclaimer that says, ""Well... any GSM carrier EXCEPT Verizon Wireless"" because they can NOT be activated on Verizon wireless. The main reason, that I understand, is the mere fact that Verizon never had a 3g iPhone, so they don't have 3g SIM cards compatible with the iPhone and the 4g SIM cards they do have will not work in the iPhone 3gS. I tried my best to get the phone activated but it was just a huge waste of time. If you have Verizon, don't bother - it's not gonna work and its just going to cause you a huge headache.One the positive side, the phone itself was very nice. It appeared to be brand new, in the box with all the accessories. Although the USB cable is not Apple brand, the description does say it includes a 'compatible' USB cable. Everything else seems legit, it turned on and the screen was flawless and bright. Just disappointed I didn't do my research about the 3g/4g SIM card business.The seller, Better Deals FASTER, was very professional and understanding. I was able to return the phone and have my money refunded as soon as they received the phone back.Buyer Tip of the Day: do your HOMEWORK and know what your carrier can activate before you go around buying $200 phones!",2

Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB Black Factory Unlocked / Not Jailbroken,Apple,33,3,I'll get to the point. I bought the phone new. I had it only two days when the on/off button fell off. I can still turn it on and off by using my fingernail. The camera's picture quality for low light could be sharper. The box wasn't factory wrapped in plastic when it arrived (which was sooner than its estimated time) so I have to wonder if it really was new. So besides the two flaws it's still a nice phone.,0

Note that OS 7 is not supported on the 3GS, but the majority of apps will run on it, as does iCloud. Given the cost of new iPhones (which are admittedly more powerful with crisper displays) I think the $149 that this goes for is a good bargain. If you are also looking for a reasonably priced case, see the¬†eForCity 2 x TPU Rubber Skin Case Compatible With Apple¬Æ iPhone¬Æ 3G / 3GS, Clear Smoke Circle¬†which I bought for under $3 including postage.

Using Skype ,front camera is not functioning even if the OS is already up to date.I'm still using the Iphone and did not return it to the seller because I'm avoiding the hassles of returns.Still I'm rating it with 3 stars.To the business owner who sold this item to me please screen your products carefully before shipping it out.In that way you can leave a very good impression to your future customers.Thank you and I hope this helps everybody who loves to shop online just like me as well as the merchants whose aim is customer satisfaction.",0

Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB Black Factory Unlocked / Not Jailbroken,Apple,33,5,"The 3 gs has slightly less resolution than the I4 but It is so clear I don't think you would notice the difference.

IF you don't need your phone to talk to you and you don't need video chatting then the 3gs does everything else. It came with the latest upgrade of the IOS operating system and the screen was scratch free. While I don't understand it completely apparently there is a big difference between factory Unlocked and Jailbroken. It is my understanding that when jailbroken any upgrade re-locks the phone.

Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB Black Factory Unlocked / Not Jailbroken,Apple,33,3,"compared to my htc sensation (yes I know that phone is wayy advanced and the comparison would be unfair) which I destroyed by getting it wet, of course it*s hard for me to give the Iphone 3s a fair review.However, here my review:The Iphone 3 is pretty and has most things you would need in a smart phone.I like the texting, even though sometimes texts especially pictures won*t send and I have to send it over and over- despite having service in the area!service..... yes, sometimes there is no service in an area for no reason. kind of annoying. I always had service with my htc so it is not my service provider. My friend who has the Iphone3 says the same thing.. very annoying.I was spoiled by having a gps tell me when to turn - the iphone 3 comes with a navigation system which is a lifesaver so and so often - but you still have to flip thru the steps manually as you go which can get you a ticket or killed at times.Some of the apps I could get for free for Android I have to pay for now.. bummer.The camera is terrible sadly, no flash, and no front screen camera..However, the phone works, it*s pretty, and if you use your phone mainly for calling and texting and only need the internet at times it works very well. I love the way the voicemails are set up!!!I don*t understand btw why apple makes the front screen from glass! I could drop my htc on concrete ten times a day and not a scratch would be on the screen but now when my Iphone slips my grip I nearly have a heart attack!",2
Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB Black Factory Unlocked / Not Jailbroken,Apple,33,4,"I never saw a review that indicated someone using the iPhone on Straight Talk but it does work on it.The iPhone arrived FACTORY UNLOCKED! So that was good. There are sites you can check to see if the iPhone is factory unlocked by inputting the MEID. I slipped in the SIM card and it works. The only thing is that the iPhone is a little beat up. You can tell that the screen was replaced cause they did not clean the under screen before applying the new screen and you can see dirt in it when looking at the screen in the light, which can be annoying.The iPhone works and battery is good. The quality is not the best and the phone was Factory Unlocked and works on Straight Talk.",0

Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB Black Factory Unlocked / Not Jailbroken,Apple,33,2,"Although the description says ""Can be upgraded, factory unlocked for any GSM carrier"" AND again states ""ready to be used on any GSM carrier worldwide"". They need to put a disclaimer that says, ""Well... any GSM carrier EXCEPT Verizon Wireless"" because they can NOT be activated on Verizon wireless. The main reason, that I understand, is the mere fact that Verizon never had a 3g iPhone, so they don't have 3g SIM cards compatible with the iPhone and the 4g SIM cards they do have will not work in the iPhone 3gS. I tried my best to get the phone activated but it was just a huge waste of time. If you have Verizon, don't bother - it's not gonna work and its just going to cause you a huge headache.One the positive side, the phone itself was very nice. It appeared to be brand new, in the box with all the accessories. Although the USB cable is not Apple brand, the description does say it includes a 'compatible' USB cable. Everything else seems legit, it turned on and the screen was flawless and bright. Just disappointed I didn't do my research about the 3g/4g SIM card business.The seller, Better Deals FASTER, was very professional and understanding. I was able to return the phone and have my money refunded as soon as they received the phone back.Buyer Tip of the Day: do your HOMEWORK and know what your carrier can activate before you go around buying $200 phones!",2

Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB Black Factory Unlocked / Not Jailbroken,Apple,33,3,I'll get to the point. I bought the phone new. I had it only two days when the on/off button fell off. I can still turn it on and off by using my fingernail. The camera's picture quality for low light could be sharper. The box wasn't factory wrapped in plastic when it arrived (which was sooner than its estimated time) so I have to wonder if it really was new. So besides the two flaws it's still a nice phone.,0
