"Apple iPad Mini 3 MGYE2LL/A NEWEST VERSION (16GB, Wi-Fi, Gold) (Certified Refurbished)",,259.99,3,Seems to be working well so far it did have a few scratches on the back as well as a generic apple charger. Definitely doesn't look like minimal to no wear as stated in the description it looks very used. I think for $250+ it should have looked a little better I could have gotten one in this condition on Craigslist for $175 or so. But I'm giving in three stars because it's running good and no damage on the actual screen. With a case on it you can't really tell.,1

"Apple iPad Mini 3 MGYE2LL/A NEWEST VERSION (16GB, Wi-Fi, Gold) (Certified Refurbished)",,259.99,5,"Purchased this as an upgrade from my first gen mini and could not pass up the savings on the refurbished model. Just got it in the mail and have been setting it up for the better part of the afternoon. I am happy with it so far, seems to work like new. I got the 128GB because I previously had only 16GB on my old iPad. I kept running out of space which was incredibly frustrating, in the last year I have had to back up to my PC twice and clear everything from the iPad. It was time consuming double checking that every one of my thousands of pictures and videos made it onto my computer/flash drive before deleting from the iPad. I literally spent hours. So I'm very glad I decided to purchase the one with the largest storage capacity this time. I expect it will save me a lot of headaches down the road as I take more photos and videos.",7
