"ALCATEL OneTouch Pixi 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.5 Display, 8GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,79.95,4,"Good phone. Responsive. Works well with Tracfone SIM card installed. Does not have unneeded propriatary apps from other cell phone providers (like an unlocked ATT&T GSM phone I had used that was a Huawei Fusion.But note carefully: It does NOT have 8 GB of internal storage! The description on this page is OFF on two locations, 1) on the heading itself and 2) in the comparison chart.Amazon sent a replacement and it had the same amount of internal storage: 4 GB. So far I have used 2.1 GB of the 4 GB. Whenever I download a new app, I make sure it is stored (if possible) to the 32 GB SD card I have in it. So far, so good, but be aware.I have contacted Customer Service and they are supposed to change the product page to reflect the 4 GB truth.",0

"ALCATEL OneTouch Pixi 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.5 Display, 8GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,79.95,5,"I wish I could give it 4.75 stars, but 4 doesn't seem like enough, so I gave it 5. For $65 ($60 as I write this), I have exactly as much phone as I want and need. Sure, the screen could be better, and I miss having an ambient light sensor, but otherwise I'm very happy. It's small enough to fit in my front pants pocket while cycling, TCL's Android is nearly stock and I get two full days on a charge. I ""upgraded"" from a first-gen Moto E, and this adds LTE, a flash (most for the flashlight), and a camera with focus.). Not bad for about half the price two years later.",1

Have had it for like two weeks and I have no complains so far.The Camera could be better (specially the front facing) but is not that bad [I'm not a selfie fan anyway].The system is fluid. It works better than muy old BLU Avance 4 which was kind of slow.Speaker quality is also not the best, but to me not a big deal.I'm happy with it, considering what I paid.'''''''''''''''''''''UPDATE''''''''''''''''''''''''''Well, just after 5 months with this cellphone, it DIED.

"ALCATEL OneTouch Pixi 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.5 Display, 8GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,79.95,5,"Great little phone for the price, works great, I get 4G LTE and it works well on T-Mobile. So far I am loving it!",0

"ALCATEL OneTouch Pixi 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.5 Display, 8GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,79.95,3,"The phone I received is model number 5017O-2AALUS1, which meets the description of the ""Global"" Pixie 3 4.5"" -- with one notable exception: It has 4.28GB of total memory, not 8GB.I'm including screen shots from ""Settings-Storage"" and ""Settings--About Phone"" which show the model number and actual memory of my phone. This was a disappointment since I need and expected 8GB. I have since tried without success to find a Pixi 3 4.5"" with 8GB of memory.While it is too limited to be my primary phone at home, I am keeping it to use while traveling in Europe. In addition to the 4G LTE frequencies used by AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM operators on this side of the pond, it has the primary European 4G LTE frequency. My home phone does not.On the whole, this is a suitable phone for beginners, those on a budget, and anyone who doesn't need enough memory to run a lot of apps. The screen resolution is less than on more expensive models, which means text and images appear larger. On a 4.5-inch screen, that's a nice benefit for people like me who are a tad hard of seeing.",1
"ALCATEL OneTouch Pixi 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.5 Display, 8GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,79.95,1,"Very disappointing overall unlocked phone says, but Venezuela did not work for me digitel 4g Lte, is a failure because in the comments and said that if work specifications.",1
"ALCATEL OneTouch Pixi 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.5 Display, 8GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,79.95,4,"I like this ALCATEL OneTouch Pixi 3 4.5-inch CELL PHONE!The 4.5"" size is not too big for my hand! I thought I'd never want anything bigger than my 3.5"" ipod, but I am able to hold this in one hand and touch the buttons without any difficulty.As a phone -- it works great -- I can hear clearly and so can the person on the other end. So far, no problems with sound at all.The camera works fine -- takes a good, clear photo. There are TWO cameras -- one front for FaceTime or Skype and one on the back for taking photos.The mobile operating system -- Android Lollipop 5.0 -- has so far allowed me to make calls without any problems.It's UNLOCKED. Global System for Mobile (GSM) for mobile communication means that I will be able to change the SIM card when I go to Europe. (At least I hope so -- I haven't tried this yet.) It also means I can change from AT&T to a different carrier if I wish to in the future. I can use pre-paid wireless plans, rather than sign up for a long-term contract -- I like these features!It holds a charge for days. I don't use this much, but I can leave it on for days before it needs to be charged. If I talked on it constantly, I assume it would need charging more often.Screen shows time and date, strength of mobile signal and wifi signal and battery charge percentage. On screen quick use icons: phone, music, calculator, camera, contact list, product code scanner. After you swipe icons: phone, messaging, menu, email, google, camera, gallery. Press Google and several icons for different apps appear. Press menu and 20 icons appear for different apps.Why do I like it and not love it -- it didn't come with a SIM. I tried to get a Tracfone SIM package at Walmart but they didn't have it. They could order it, though. I went to the at&t store where the sales associate put in the SIM and sold me a package that got progressively more expensive as we went along. First it was $25 -- okay, not too bad. Then another $30 for ""RTR"" (a month's worth of minutes?), then a 40-cent FEE, AND TAX $3.85. I got out of there for $59.25 for the SIM and one month of service! Add this to the cost of the phone and one hopes that this is a phone that will work well for years. (I realize I have to add more minutes and this will cost more.) One big benefit -- the sales rep installed the SIM, let me select from a list of potential phone numbers and then swiped through a series of installation menus. (Thank you Dyllan!)One caveat: I noticed that the sales rep had to scratch off the waxy surface on the SIM package. These ""shavings"" stick to the fingers and could easily get on the SIM card, which is quite small, and ""gum up"" the electronics when the card slips into its slot.This comes with earphones, a manual, charger plug and an in-depth online manual and online support. I couldn't find much online information about installing the SIM and depended on amazon's great Q&A feature and the advice of some very helpful and supportive people.",6
"ALCATEL OneTouch Pixi 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.5 Display, 8GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,79.95,5,"Good cell phone, is like the description, is unlocked for Digitel and Movistar in Venezuela",1
"ALCATEL OneTouch Pixi 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.5 Display, 8GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,79.95,5," Let's get the specs out of the way. You can find specs online for this model, but I'll make it easy and list the biggies for you:Originally launched in August of 2015Phone Size: 5.55 x 2.81 x 0.39 inDisplay: 480x854 pixels (196 ppi density) This isn't super great but it's respectable, especially if this is your first smart phone!Lollypop OS, likely won’t be upgraded to Marshmallow (that is a guess – I don’t know that for sure but Marshmallow is getting pushed out now) Dual core processorMemory: Internal 8 GB, 1 GB RAM (4G model, which this is) also a micro SD slot up to 32GB but you must add that yourself, it is not included.Camera is a 5 megapixel. Has auto focus, Flash, Geo-taging. Video is 720p at 30 frames per second.. Selfie mode is 2 mp.Has Bluetooth capabilities, and GPS.Battery is a removable and is a 1400mAh battery.What to like about it? It's an inexpensive entry level phone. If you live in an area that gets good service from the providers they listed this would be an excellent option. If you live in an area where you can only get Verizon service (which this phone is not compatible with) then this would not be a good choice as a cell phone. Research what carrier people in your area use to see if it is one of the recommended ones.I found it to be pretty responsive, and it works just like my more expensive Note 4. Google Play store access, and most everything runs fine on this phone that I tested out.This phone has the advantage of the SD slot to add extra memory, which I did. In this way I can put all my movies and music on there and have them handy all the time. 32GB is fairly large and you can fit a lot on there.The battery is removable so if you wanted to buy an extra battery to ""swap out"" in emergencies if you didn't have a way to charge it - that is so handy. I do that with my other phone and I feel sorry for people without removable batteries. I travel a lot and so having that is a huge win.What not to like about it? For me the screen is way too small. But I am used to a HUGE phablet style phone. So for me the small screen seems like a downgrade. You may not feel that way though... it is subjective.Who is this phone good for? First time smart phone users for sure. For kids who you don't want to spend a lot of money to have a phone for, but still need a smart phone. Or budget conscious people. This phone is not very costly. These are the three main groups.",21
