"[XMAS DEAL] Jethro [SC118] Simple Unlocked Quad-band GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Button, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Large Keyboard [New Firmware Edition]",Jethro,59.99,3,"This may be an issue of expectation mismatch. For one thing, the phone is much smaller than I expected. Some might think this is a good thing. But for many elderly and hearing aid equipped people, it would work better if the physical dimensions were larger. Secondly, the time to hold the red button for turning the phone off is too short. My 90 year old mother in law often turns the phone off when she is hanging up.That being said, the phone works fine. The buttons and numbers are large.",5

He has At&t, I did put the SIM card from his At&t phone in the Jethro, it worked. The only Problem he was having was dropped calls. He would receive or make a phone call and the phone would hang up on the person on the other line. I'm asking for a refund. It wasn't his carrier, it's the phone. He had 3 or 4 bars when the phone calls took place.",0
"[XMAS DEAL] Jethro [SC118] Simple Unlocked Quad-band GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Button, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Large Keyboard [New Firmware Edition]",Jethro,59.99,4,"This is a great, simple phone which is getting to be harder and harder to find. For those who do NOT want a smartphone and just need a phone for an elderly family member or for someone who is not tech savvy, this is a great little phone. I gave it four stars, though because our carrier - AT&T - does not recognize the signature of this phone, so we wound up having to buy an AT&T friendly phone. The phone works, but when we are billed their system would automatically charge this as a smartphone - which is an extra $40 on our bill - since it did not recognize the signature :/ We will be giving it to the military to reuse.",9

"[XMAS DEAL] Jethro [SC118] Simple Unlocked Quad-band GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Button, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Large Keyboard [New Firmware Edition]",Jethro,59.99,5,"As good as you can hope for in a phone for seniors. Reminiscent of a cordless house phone -- makes it easy to use for an 84-year-old. Buttons light up bright, ringtone volume is adjustable and on max it's more than loud enough for anyone with a hearing problem; though surprisingly the call volume is not adjustable, though it is louder than the previous Verizon flip phone on max volume. I set this up with Cricket service. The phone takes a MINI SIM CARD. Not a micro as someone else has stated. I had to buy another sim card because the micro I ordered was too small. Mini sims are the original, large cards. We live in the US. I don't know people are claiming this phone doesn't work in the US. I paid 30ish for this phone, but would have paid up to 100 for it because of the design and functionality. Side note: I was concerned that my grandmother would always accidentally hit the SOS button this phone has, but it can be disabled in the settings.",23

"[XMAS DEAL] Jethro [SC118] Simple Unlocked Quad-band GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Button, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Large Keyboard [New Firmware Edition]",Jethro,59.99,5,"With a little bit of effort I was able to familiarize myself with this phone, and using it became intuitive. It came with a nice easy to read booklet, and before purchasing it I checked to see if it has a web, site which it does. I inserted the sim card and charged the battery which took a couple of hours. I did have several problems at first, but this was my first cell phone so I didn't have much experience. I mistakenly set the language to Portuguese so I couldn't figure out what to do. Luckily there were several online tutorials at the web site and I restored the phone to the factory setting. Once in English I was able to figure the phone out more easily. One thing I figured out was to use military time as in 2pm equal 1400 when setting the time as there was no am or pm setting. All in all I am happy with the phone. Being hearing impaired I am able to hear the basic ring which is loud. When I put it in my pocket I face the keypad to my leg as the speaker comes out the back and it's even louder. Same thing when I set it on the table I put it face down and the ring is loud and clear. I questioned about using a lanyard and e-mailed the Jethro company. They got right back to me and confirmed that a small hole on the upper left side could accommodate a lanyard by removing the back, feeding the lanyard through the hole and looping it around before replacing the back. The customer service was nice and answered my question in an easy to understand manner. The phone will lock in my pocket so it wont random dial. All I need to do is press the * asterisks until the screen says the phone is unlocked, then I can dial out. The phone always accepts a call without turning it on. This is exactly the simple phone I was looking for. I returned several that did not work. I went with this model so I can use it with Consumer Cellular which is less expensive. For $14.25 (with my AARP discount) I get 4 hours of talk per month.",11
"[XMAS DEAL] Jethro [SC118] Simple Unlocked Quad-band GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Button, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Large Keyboard [New Firmware Edition]",Jethro,59.99,5,"Great simple to use phone for my mother. Big buttons, easy to see and use. She has the use of only one arm so the charge cradle is a great benefit. Easy setup, good clarity, gets good signal.",1
"[XMAS DEAL] Jethro [SC118] Simple Unlocked Quad-band GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Button, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Large Keyboard [New Firmware Edition]",Jethro,59.99,4,"I bought it for my mom who is in her late 70s after her other highest rated ""senior"" phone stopped working. I hated that other phone as it was very confusing for me to operate the menu functions. So I took a chance on this one despite some of the complaints I read about in the reviews.Some of those problems have been addressed and corrected. It is no longer difficult to lock or unlock the keys. You press the lower left button down for a couple of seconds and the word locked comes up, I assume, since that's what it says in Spanish. I set my mom's phone to Spanish. There is a second way of doing it with a directional key, but we didn't need to try it since my mom got it right away. And she is definitely not good with technology.Another complaint was about the clock being set to military, or 24 hr time. Well, you can now choose to set it to 12 hr.The phone was easy to set, which was a relief for me, compared to her previous phone. Let's face it, it's the non seniors who will probably have to set it up. Sometimes in an effort to simplify phones, they take away buttons which makes them harder to navigate.The phone is very light weight. The ringer is loud enough. I like the cradle, which is easier for a senior. You can't beat the price. It worked well with the SIM card.On the negative side, I will agree with one complaint, it's not loud enough. I turned the volume all the way up and was afraid mom would not be able to hear the caller. She agreed to give it a chance, but we may have to exchange it since her hearing is not great. The back cover is thin plastic and I was afraid to break it when I removed it. I wish it had an alarm.When it comes to ""senior"" phones, it's slim pickings. This one is half the price of the old one and comes close to meeting all the requirements. Since most seniors are hard of hearing, they really need to make it louder.",20

It is pretty nice. It is fairly easy to use. Most importantly, it has large buttons and a fairly large display. It was also easy to add to my AT&T account.A couple of negatives. The SOS button is a nice feature, but is fairly easy to set off. So be prepared for false alarms. Another issue, the phone only displays the time in a 24 hours system. For example, 2:00pm is 14:00. This is extremely confusing for my mother. I bought this phone last Nov. I called Jethro sometime in Dec regarding this and was advised there was a firmware update coming out late Dec / early Jan. I waited until Feb & emailed. Told an update to fix this is time display issue was expected in March and to continue checking back with their support section of their website. I've called & emailed several times regarding this issue and I am told the same thing everytime; a fireware update is coming. It has now been 6 months.

We have t-mobile and all our phones work inside the house except this one. Apparently it's only 2g which is being phased out. So expect reception to get worse over time.* The time/date was not set automatically. Seriously? What year is this?* Unlike every other phone, the buttons directly under the screen are not actually the navigation buttons, they are M1 and M2 which are speed dials. Probably not a problem if this is someone's first phone, but it drove me nuts.* no FCC id! This phone might be illegal to use in the US.* Poor manufacturing quality - the battery is hard to insert and remove because the battery is slightly too big for the part where it's supposed to fit* The voice mail number has to be programmed. Similar to the time/date, every other phone I've ever had picked this setting up from the network automatically.* As other reviews have mentioned, the hangup button, if pressed for longer than about 1 second, the phone powers off. Easy to accidentally do.",0

I like the big buttons and the charging cradle. The phone feels cheap. I was afraid I'd break the plastic pieces pulling off the cover to get to the battery and SIM card. We I nstalled 3 different SIM cards from Cricket Wireless (AT&T network) at their store and could not get it connected. Don't know for sure if it's something broken on the phone or just an incompatibility. Other reviewers saying they have connected on AT&T leads me to think something is wrong with the phone.

"[XMAS DEAL] Jethro [SC118] Simple Unlocked Quad-band GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Button, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Large Keyboard [New Firmware Edition]",Jethro,59.99,2,"This phone is very difficult to unlock. To unlock the phone, you need to press the unlock key 3 times. The first press wakes up the phone, the second press results in a message which says to press the unlock key to unlock. The third press unlocks the phone. There isn't any easier method for unlocking the keyboard without disabling the lock altogether.If you are buying this phone for someone elderly with technology ""issues"" (as we did), they may have a lot of difficulty using this phone. If the three unlock presses aren't done quick enough, the unlock sequence has to be started again. If the unlock key is pressed 4 times, the phone will be locked again instead of being unlocked. All of this is very difficult to explain to someone with dexterity and technology issues.I have never heard of a phone that is this difficult to unlock. It's hard to believe that there isn't an easier method to unlock the phone. However, I have called customer support and they confirmed that the phone does take 3 unlock presses to unlock the phone. The only alternative is to disable the lock feature.On the plus side, the SOS key does work very well and doesn't require one to unlock the keys. The SOS key can be programmed to send text messages and call 911.Another thing to note is that the title for this phone indicates that there is an extra 20% off today. However, they raised the price by about 10% yesterday to $39.99. So, you aren't saving 20%. I hate when companies raise a price just so they can tell you that you are going to save ""more"".

"[XMAS DEAL] Jethro [SC118] Simple Unlocked Quad-band GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Button, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Large Keyboard [New Firmware Edition]",Jethro,59.99,3,"This may be an issue of expectation mismatch. For one thing, the phone is much smaller than I expected. Some might think this is a good thing. But for many elderly and hearing aid equipped people, it would work better if the physical dimensions were larger. Secondly, the time to hold the red button for turning the phone off is too short. My 90 year old mother in law often turns the phone off when she is hanging up.That being said, the phone works fine. The buttons and numbers are large.",5

"[XMAS DEAL] Jethro [SC118] Simple Unlocked Quad-band GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Button, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Large Keyboard [New Firmware Edition]",Jethro,59.99,1,"I bought this phone for my elderly parent. He has At&t, I did put the SIM card from his At&t phone in the Jethro, it worked. The only Problem he was having was dropped calls. He would receive or make a phone call and the phone would hang up on the person on the other line. I'm asking for a refund. It wasn't his carrier, it's the phone. He had 3 or 4 bars when the phone calls took place.",0
"[XMAS DEAL] Jethro [SC118] Simple Unlocked Quad-band GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Button, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Large Keyboard [New Firmware Edition]",Jethro,59.99,4,"This is a great, simple phone which is getting to be harder and harder to find. For those who do NOT want a smartphone and just need a phone for an elderly family member or for someone who is not tech savvy, this is a great little phone. I gave it four stars, though because our carrier - AT&T - does not recognize the signature of this phone, so we wound up having to buy an AT&T friendly phone. The phone works, but when we are billed their system would automatically charge this as a smartphone - which is an extra $40 on our bill - since it did not recognize the signature :/ We will be giving it to the military to reuse.",9
