"5.5"" Cellphone Dual Sim Unlocked Android 5.1 Quad Core-JUNING Smartphone White",JUNING,99.99,4,"This phone is very good for daily use like calling, texting, social media or net surfing. It's fast and the big 5.5"" inch screen is making things on the screen bigger and easy to read. I've been using this mainly for watching Youtube. My son loves using this as the screen is way bigger as compared to my iPhone 5C.This also came with a screen protector and a clear case that's a little gray in color. It is a dual sim card phone and you can also put an SD card inside the phone if you want to expand the memory.The only downside of this phone is the lack of internal space memory. I can't freely download anything I want into this phone because there's not enough space and right now I don't have a spare SD card to use for this phone. I really wish that for a nice phone like this, they should just make this an 8GB memory space rather than 4GB.Over all, this phone works as expected. For the price it's fair and a good size Android phone to have especially if you like YouTube or watch videos online.",2
