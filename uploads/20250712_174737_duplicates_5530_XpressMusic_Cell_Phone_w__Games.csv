5530 XpressMusic Cell Phone w/ Games,NOKIA,123,2,"Bought this phone as a factory-refurb. When it arrived, I plugged it in to charge and the splash screen came up... great I thought and walked away. Looked an hr later to check the progress and nothing had changed! No status bar, nothing! This should have been my first indication of trouble. Unplugged, plugged, unplugged, plugged and then the status bar came up...A cool feature is that the phone gives an audible alert when the battery is full! But then it was a witch to get it to turn on! Hold the button, wait for splash screen, wait to see if it initializes... if/when it doesn't, take the back off, take the battery out and start all over... usually 4-5 times before the phone would initialize! At first, I just figured this was a consequence of the battery being completely dead but nope... had to go through this EVERY time the phone was turned off!So I returned it (under the 30 day warranty) and the seller sent a new phone. Great! Well, I couldn't get the new phone past the splash screen no matter what I did!!!So, as far as features once I did get the first phone to work...The music player is really pretty nice! The built-in speakers sound great for a phone! The touch screen is responsive and the phone feels great in your hand! And, the wifi was pretty cool... BUT (and now the bad)... you can't see anything on the screen in direct sunlight! the headphone jack is proprietary. And, there aren't a lot of apps... I mean, even the facebook ""app"" was essentially a bookmark to the FB webpage. For this price point, I wasn't expecting an iPhone but seriously, this phone left a lot to be desired!So, my opinion is that this phone is a POS... 1/2 star for the phone working nicely when it worked, 1/2 star for the features, and 1 star for the music player sounding so great... Don't bother...",1
